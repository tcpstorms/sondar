# Sondar

Sondar is currently under development and needs awesome people like **you** to contribute to the project!

Sondar aspires to be a full-fledged network scanner written in Go; which may be similar to [Nmap](https://github.com/nmap/nmap) with the use of Goroutines and more, making it more efficient and performant.

As of now, you can use it to do simple port scans on specific hosts.

# Sondar

Sondar is currently under development and needs awesome people like **YOU** to contribute to the project!

Sondar aspires to be a full-fledged network scanner written in Go; similar to [Nmap](https://github.com/nmap/nmap). And with Go's speed, simplicity and reliability along with it's well designed built-in concurrency; it may turn out to be more efficient and better performant than most other network scanners; and that's basically the goal.

As of now, you can use it to do simple port scans on specified hosts.

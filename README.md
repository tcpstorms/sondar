# Sondar

Sondar is currently under development and needs awesome people like **YOU** to contribute to the project!

Sondar aspires to be a full-fledged network scanner written in Go; similar to [Nmap](https://github.com/nmap/nmap). And with the use Go's features such as goroutines and more, it may turn out to be more efficient and better performant than most other network scanners; which is basically the goal.

As of now, you can use it to do simple port scans on specified hosts.

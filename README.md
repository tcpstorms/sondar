# Sondar

Welcome to Sondar, a full-fledged network scanner written in Go! We are currently in the development phase and are looking for talented contributors like you to help bring Sondar to its full potential. With Go's emphasis on speed, simplicity, and reliability, as well as its well-designed concurrency features, Sondar has the potential to be more efficient and performant than other network scanners on the market. Currently, you can use Sondar to perform simple port scans on specified hosts.
